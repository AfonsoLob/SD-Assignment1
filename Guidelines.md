# Election Day Simulation - Implementation Breakdown

## 1. Characterize State-Level Interaction
### Entities & Shared State
- **Voters**: Enter, validate ID, vote, exit, and go through reborn state.
- **E-Voting Booth**: Handles the actual voting process.
- **Poll Clerk**: Manages polling station, ID verification, and voting process.
- **Pollster**: Approaches voters for exit polls.
- **Polling Station**: Controls entry, waiting queue, and synchronization.

### State Variables & Transformations
#### 1. Polling Station
- `queueSize`: Tracks the number of voters inside the polling station.
#### 2. Pollster
- `pollResponses`: Collects pollster responses.
#### 3. Poll Clerk
- `validIDs`: Stores IDs to prevent duplicate voting.
#### 4. E-Voting Booth
- `boothAvailable`: Boolean flag to indicate if the e-voting booth is available.
- `votes`: Stores votes cast for each candidate.

## 2. Specify the Life Cycle and Internal Properties of Each Entity
### **Voter Life Cycle**
1. Created, enters polling station, waits in queue.
2. ID validation â†’ If valid, proceeds to voting booth
3. Votes and exits the booth.
4. Chance of responding to exit poll.
5. Leaves and may be reborn.

### **Poll Clerk Life Cycle**
1. Starts when station opens.
2. Validates voter IDs.
3. Sends voters to the **e-voting booth** one by one.
4. Closes station after a predefined number of voters.

### **E-Voting Booth Life Cycle**
1. Waits for a voter.
2. Processes the vote.
3. Notifies poll clerk once voting is done.
4. Becomes available for the next voter.

### **Pollster Life Cycle**
1. Intercepts voters randomly (based on a probability).
2. Requests responses.

## 3. Define Information Sharing Regions
### **Data Structures & Operations**
- `Queue<Voter>` for waiting area (review: probably ConcurrentQueue as well):
  - `enqueue()`, `dequeue()`
- `HashSet<Integer>` for used voter IDs:
  - `add()`, `contains()`
- 2x `HashMap<String, Integer>` for votes (voting booth & pollster):
  - `updateVote()`
- `ConcurrentQueue<Voter>` for exit polling:
  - `addResponse()`

### **Synchronization Points**
- **Entry Queue**: Monitor/Semaphore to limit voters.
- **ID Validation & Voting**: Ensure only one voter at a time.
- **E-Voting Booth Access**: Mutex/Monitor to prevent simultaneous usage.
- **Exit Poll**: Mutex for accessing voter responses.?
