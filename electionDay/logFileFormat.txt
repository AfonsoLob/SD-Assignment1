Election Simulation Log File Format

Overview
The log file (log.txt) captures all events during the election simulation. It uses a table format with rows representing events and columns representing different aspects of the simulation state.

File Structure

Header
The first line contains the simulation parameters:
Total of Voters:[maxVoters], Total Voters in Stations:[maxCapacity], Votes to end: [maxVotes] voters

Column Headers
The second line contains column headers separated by pipe (|) characters:
| Door       | Voter      | Clerk      | Validation | Booth      | ScoreA     | ScoreB     | Exit       | ExitPollA  | ExitPollB  |

Delimiter
The third line is a delimiter to separate headers from data:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Data Rows
Each subsequent row represents an event in the simulation with the following columns:

1. Door: Indicates polling station status
   - Op - Station opening
   - Cl - Station closing

2. Voter: ID of voter arriving at the polling station

3. Clerk: ID of voter being called by the clerk to enter the queue

4. Validation: ID validation result
   - [ID]+ - Voter ID is valid
   - [ID]- - Voter ID is invalid/rejected

5. Booth: Voting booth activity
   - [ID]A - Voter cast vote for candidate A
   - [ID]B - Voter cast vote for candidate B

6. ScoreA: Current total votes for candidate A

7. ScoreB: Current total votes for candidate B

8. Exit: Voter exiting the polling station
   - [ID] - Voter exiting without participating in exit poll
   - [ID]A - Voter reported voting for A in exit poll
   - [ID]B - Voter reported voting for B in exit poll

9. ExitPollA: Current total exit poll votes for candidate A

10. ExitPollB: Current total exit poll votes for candidate B

Example Rows

| Op         |            |            |            |            |            |            |            |            |            |
This row indicates the polling station has opened.

|            | 42         |            |            |            |            |            |            |            |            |
This row indicates voter 42 has arrived at the polling station.

|            |            | 42         |            |            |            |            |            |            |            |
This row indicates voter 42 has been called by the clerk to enter the queue.

|            |            |            | 42+        |            |            |            |            |            |            |
This row indicates voter 42 has had their ID validated successfully.

|            |            |            |            | 42B        | 03         | 07         |            |            |            |
This row indicates voter 42 has cast a vote for candidate B, and the current scores are 3 votes for A and 7 votes for B.

|            |            |            |            |            |            |            | 42         |            |            |
This row indicates voter 42 has exited the polling station without participating in the exit poll.

Reading the Log File
The log file can be parsed sequentially to reconstruct the entire election process. Each column has a specific meaning, and only relevant columns are populated for a given event. The file shows the evolution of the election over time, including:

1. Voter arrivals and queue management
2. ID validation successes and failures
3. Voting patterns
4. Exit poll participation and accuracy
5. Station opening and closing events

The final rows of the log file show the simulation's conclusion and final vote counts for both actual votes and exit poll results.
